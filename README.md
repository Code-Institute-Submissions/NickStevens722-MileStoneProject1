# Code Institute Golf Society Website

Milestone Project 1: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a website for a fictional golf society, designed as a way for the members to see details on future events and for others to potentially join.

## UX

The puspose behind the design for the website is for people to be able to find the information they are looking for intuitively. There would be two different types of users, members looking for either the results or the details of the next event. Or prospective members looking for information about the society or a way to contact the society.

To make this easier the navigation links are well labeled and tell the user exactly what the pages contain.

The diary and the rules section use the card system to make it easy to edit the amount of content in those sections.

## Features To Add

The main feature that I would have liked to add would have been google maps integration on the diary page next to the travel information.

## Live Demo

The deployed site can be found at this [link](https://nickstevens722.github.io/MileStoneProject1/).

## Technologies

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
4. Bootstrap 4

## Testing

The site was self tested on multiple browsers and at multiple screen sizes to ensure compatibility.

## Deployment

The site is published on GitHub pages from the master branch and the link is provided above.
