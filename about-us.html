				<h3>About Us</h3>
				<p>The Torreblanca Golf Society is one of the oldest and most successful golf societies on the coast.
					But more ​importantly it is the friendliest. </p>
				​<p>The society was formed not only to play golf but for social activities. Our members are all friends
					(well sometimes), when we are not playing golf we meet regularly socially for theatre visits,
					BBQ,'s meals out etc.</p>
				<p>We have a varied membership of lady and men players from many different countries.</p>
				​<p>Their handicaps range from 1 to 28/36.</p>
				<p>We welcome new members and guests of all abilities. Whether you are based in Spain, the UK, or any
					other
					country. Guests are welcome providing there are tee times available. Members will always have
					priority
					when booking tee times.</p>
				​<p>We play different courses every Thursday so why not join us for a competitive but more importantly a
					friendly game of golf at competitive prices.</p>
				​
				<p>Every year we hold our own version of the four majors. The US masters, The US Open, The British Open
					and
					The PGA.</p>
				<p>However the highlight of our year is our version of the Ryder Cup. Not Europe versus America but the
					North of England versus the South. This takes place in September each year when we travel away with
					our
					partners to a golf resort for four days.</p>
				<p>This is one trip not to be missed.</p>
